## Containerization with Docker

Containerization, powered by Dockerüê≥ , provides an isolated and consistent environment for our Bobo application, ensuring it runs uniformly from a developer's local environment to a production server. This section outlines the steps to set up, build, and run the Bobo application using Docker and Docker Compose.

### üåü Why Docker?

- **Consistency**: Say goodbye to "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale up services as needed.
- **Isolation**: Your application and its environment are bundled together.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up with Local MySQL Server

If you're running a MySQL server locally and wish the containerized Bobo app to connect to it, update the `settings.py` in the Django application. Set the `DATABASES` configuration's `HOST` field to `host.docker.internal`. This ensures seamless communication between the containerized app and services on the host machine.

### üîß Building and Running without Docker Compose

1. **Building the Image**: Use the Docker CLI to build an image from the Dockerfile.
    ```bash
    docker build -t bobo_app:v1 .
    ```
2. **View Built Images**: Confirm the image was created.
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```
3. **Run a Container**: Spin up a container instance from the built image.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 bobo_app:v1
    ```
4. **Check Containers**: View all running containers.
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
5. **Stopping a Container**: When done, you can stop the container.
    ```bash
    docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
    ```

### üîÑ Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. For the Bobo app, it's the magic wand that builds and runs both the Django application and its MySQL database effortlessly.

- **Start Services**: This builds (if needed) and runs the services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
- **Stop Services**: When done, use the following command to stop the services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### üóÉÔ∏è Configuring MySQL in Docker

The initial setup of our MySQL container is steered by environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`. Once you spin up the containers, ensure that the `settings.py` in your Django app is pointing to this MySQL instance by setting the database `HOST` to `db`. To run migrations inside the container:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

---

## Continous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a foundational pillar in DevOps, emphasizing the regular integration of code into a shared repository. Each integration can then be automatically tested and verified, ensuring that new changes don't introduce bugs. For our Bobo application, CI ensures that our codebase remains reliable, efficient, and ready for deployment at all times.

### -Why GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool provided directly within GitHub, enabling developers to automate tasks right within their repositories. With GitHub Actions, Bobo's codebase undergoes automated processes every time there's a change, ensuring quality and consistency.

### -Setting Up GitHub Actions

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Access the "Actions" tab within your GitHub repository.
2. **Workflow Creation**: Choose a predefined workflow or set up a custom workflow.
3. **YAML File Configuration**: Define your workflow using the provided YAML editor. This file dictates the actions, triggers, and jobs.
4. **Commit**: Save and commit your YAML file to the repository.
5. **Monitor**: Post-commit, GitHub Actions will execute the workflow. Monitor the progress under the "Actions" tab.

### -Bobo's CI Workflow

The `.yml` file for Bobo details our CI steps:

- **Triggers**: Activates on `push` and `pull_request` events to the master branch.
- **Jobs**: Runs on the latest Ubuntu machine.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Code Checkout**: Fetches the latest code.
  2. **Python Setup**: Initiates Python 3.9.
  3. **Dependencies**: Installs requirements via pip.
  4. **Testing**: Executes Django's testing suite.
  5. **Docker Integration**: Builds a Docker image and runs tests inside the Docker container.

## Deploy To Azure

Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, provides a robust infrastructure for hosting applications, databases, and services. For Bobo, Azure App Services, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Blob Storage are utilized to host the application, database, and media files, respectively. For a comprehensive guide, check Azure documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-python-postgresql-app?tabs=django%2Cmac-linux&pivots=azure-portal)

![stack](static/images/stack.png)

### -Azure App Services
- **Web App and Database**: Search for "Web App + Database" in the Azure portal to create new resources. Choose Python 3.9 for the runtime stack, and select PostgreSQL for the database.
- **Resource Group**: Create a new group to house the resources.
- **Hosting Plan**: Start with the Basic tier, and adjust according to your needs as your application scales.

### -Configure Application Settings
In the Azure portal, under your App Service's Configuration section, verify that the auto-generated connection strings for PostgreSQL and Redis are present. These settings are crucial for the application's database interactions and caching mechanism.

### -Deploy the Application
**Configure GitHub Actions for continuous deployment**:
- Configure the [azure.py](./Bobo/azure.py) file with the PostgreSQL and Redis connection strings, enable the [settings.py](./Bobo/settings.py) to use the azure.py file in production.
- Navigate to the "Deployment Center" in your App Service.
- Select GitHub as the source and configure the build provider with your repository details.
- Save to commit a workflow file to your repository, enabling automatic deployment on git push events.
- A workflow file will be created in the `.github/workflows` directory, detailing the deployment steps.

### -Verify Connectivity and Run Migrations
Ensure your application can connect to the database and cache services:

- Use the SSH feature in App Service to open a terminal session.
- Run python manage.py migrate to apply database migrations.

### -Blob Storage for Media Files
Azure Blob Storage is a cost-effective solution for storing media files, such as images and videos. To integrate Blob Storage with Bobo:

- Create a new Blob Storage account in the Azure portal.
- Generate a new container for storing media files.
- Create and add blob storage as a service connector to your App Service in the Azure portal.
- Update the [azure.py](./Bobo/azure.py) file with the Blob Storage credentials.

### -Monitor Application Performance
Azure Monitor provides insights into your application's performance, health, and usage. Use Azure Monitor to track metrics, set up alerts, and monitor the application's overall health.

### -Scaling and Load Balancing
